### The MinION Mk1C

 - The MinION Mk1C provides a truly portable sequencing option, with built in compute and touchscreen.
 - For the price, however, the hardware is not particularly impressive.

```

### The GridION

 - The GridION offers a "medium-throughput" option for Nanopore-based sequencing: 
 can run up to five flowcells at once.
 - The MinION (Mk1B and Mk1C) and GridION use the same flow cells
 - The Otago Genomics Facility has one of these.

### The Flongle

 - The Flongle uses an adapter to allow a smaller (and cheaper) flow cell to be used in the MinION and GridION devices.
 - Single-use system provides low-cost option for targeted sequencing (e.g., diagnostic applications).

### PromethION

 - The higher throughout PromethION uses a smaller cartridge-like flow cell. Two options: 24 or 48 flow cells.

### MinION flowcell characteristics

 - MinION flowcells typically have ~1200-1800 active pores (ONT guarantees at least 800 active pores).
 - Sequencing occurs at roughly 450 bases per second (ONT recommends keeping speed above 300 bases per second - additional reagents can be added to "refuel" the flowcell*)
 - BUT: pores are not constantly active, and can become blocked during the run

### Nanopore technology

### Nanopore technology

 - A motor protein (green) passes a strand of DNA through a nanopore (blue). The current is changed as the bases G, A, T and C pass through the pore in different combinations.

### Technological advances...

 - Since its introduction, nanopore sequencing has seen a number of improvements.
 - The initial product was realtively slow, expensive (per base sequenced) and error prone (i.e., incorrect bases calls).
 - Incremental improvements have led to major advances in both speed and accuracy.

 
### 2D sequencing (prior to 2017)

 - Hairpin-based approach provided natural error detection methodology:
   - Link DNA strands with a hairpin adapter.
   - Sequence template strand followed by complement.
   - Basecall and compare sequences to produce consensus.

### The hairpin lawsuit...

 - PacBio (competitor in the long-read space) and ONT have filed a number of lawsuits against each other over the past few years.

### 1D$^2$ sequencing

 - In 2017 ONT announced the new 1D$^2$ chemistry
 - Showed higher accuracy that 1D (and SAID it was better than 2D)
 - It didn't last long... 



```{r, out.width="50%"}

### Pore imporvements: the R10 pore

 - ONT introduced the new R10 pore in 2019 (previous was R9.4.1).
 - Main differences were *longer barrel* and *dual reader head:* gave improved resolution of homopolymer runs.




```{r, out.width="50%"}

```

### R10.3 vs R9.4.1 performance 

 - With a bit more tweaking (to get to R10.3) ONT improved 1D (i.e., single-strand) sequencing accuracy, although throughput is still not as high as the R.9.4.1 pore.

### Q20+: the return of 2D reads...

- The previous ONT products are "Q10" (we'll discuss this soon), meaning that the error rate is roughly 1 incorrect base call per 10 bases (that's high!)
- The new "Q20+" products are now available  - moves to less than 1 error per 100 bases (a little more respectable, but still well below short-read technologies like Illumina).
- Upgrade includes a return to the "2D" approach.
