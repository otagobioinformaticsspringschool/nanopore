This lesson will introduce the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platform, and will work through the process of generating data using an ONT sequencing device (e.g., Flongle, MinION, GridION, PromethION), moving that data to a separate compute system, then running through a typical workflow (e.g., basecalling, quality assessment, read alignment, variant calling).
