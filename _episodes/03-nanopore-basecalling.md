### Data generation

During the sequencing run, the electric trace ("squiggle") data are stored in `.fast5` files, which utilse the HDF5 file format:
 
"Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is a set of file formats (HDF4, HDF5) designed to store and organize large amounts of data. Originally 
developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, it is supported by The HDF Group, a non-profit corporation whose 
mission is to ensure continued development of HDF5 technologies and the continued accessibility of data stored in HDF."

[https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/about-hdf5](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/about-hdf5)

 - A single ONT flowcell produces a large amount of data - very roughly, 1Gbp of sequence data requires 1GB of storage (e.g., as gzipped fastq), 
 but to generate 1Gbp of sequence requires 10GB of electrical trace data, so potentially up to 500GB of files for a 72 hour MinION run 
 (a 30Gbp run will typically generate 300-400GB of `.fast5` files).

 - As the data are generated, they are saved as `.fast5` files in either the `fast5_pass` or `fast5_fail` folders, depending on whether reads 
 passed or failed the quality assessment process, based on the criteria that were specified when setting up the run in MinKNOW. 

 - Each `.fast5` file contains squiggle data for 1000 reads, so MANY files are created in a single sequencing run (e.g., a run generating five millions reads 
 will produce 5000 `.fast5` files, which are split across the `fast5_pass` and `fast5_fail` folders).

 - If realtime basecalling is performed during the run, then there will also be the equivalent number of `.fastq` files generated (1000 reads per file), 
 split across the `fastq_pass` and `fastq_fail` folders.


### Basecalling workflow

In order to analyse the data from a sequencing run, the FAST5 "squiggle" data needs to be converted to base calls.
The ONT software application "guppy" can be used to process FAST5 data into FASTQ format - this is the de facto standard 
for storage of sequence data and associated base-level quality scores.

 - ONT provides software (MinKNOW) for operating the MinION, and for generating the sequence data (e.g., the `guppy` basecaller).
 - Once the raw FAST5 data have been converted to basecalls, we can use more familiar tools for quality assessment and analysis (e.g., FastQC).

[https://nanoporetech.com/nanopore-sequencing-data-analysis](https://nanoporetech.com/nanopore-sequencing-data-analysis)

The current version of the Guppy software can be downloaded from the "Software Downloads" section of the Nanopore Community website:

https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads

Note that you will need to create a login to access the website.  

Today we will be using `guppy_basecaller` on the NeSI system to generate FASTQ data from a set of FAST5 files.



## Recap: FASTQ data format


### Assessing sequence quality: phred scores

<img src="../fig/01-phred.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />

Ewing B, Green P. (1998): Base-calling of automated sequencer traces using phred. II. Error probabilities. Genome Res. 8(3):186-194.


<img src="../fig/01-phred2.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />

Can use ASCII to represent quality scores by adding 33 to the phred score and converting to ASCII.
 - Quality score of 38 becomes 38+33=71: “G”

<img src="../fig/01-asciitable.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />

 - The FASTQ format allows the storage of both sequence and quality information for each read.
 - This is a compact text-based format that has become the de facto standard for storing data from next generation sequencing experiments.

## E coli data set on NeSI

For this part of the workshop we are working at:

~~~

Let's change to that directory now:

~~~
cd ~/obss_2022/nanopore/ecoli-data/
~~~
{: .bash}

FAST5 files from sequencing *E. coli* are available in the directory:

~~~
fast5_pass
~~~
{: .output}

~~~

### Basecalling: `guppy`

 - `guppy` is a neural network based basecaller.
    - analyses the electrical trace data and predicts base 
    - it is GPU-aware, and can basecall in real time 
    - can also call base modifications (e.g., 5mC, 6mA)
    - high accuracy mode (slower) and super-high accuracy mode (even slower) can improve basecalls post-sequencing
 - The software is provided by ONT, and the source code is available via a developer agreement.
 - Output is the standard "FASTQ" format for sequence data.

### Using `guppy` on NeSI

The `guppy_basecaller` software can use GPUs to speed up the basecalling process.

On NeSI, we can access the A100 GPUs by submitting a job to the cluster using a slurm script.

The slurm script we will use can be found at:

~~~
scripts/guppy_fastmodel.sl
~~~
{: .output}


Let's have a look at the content:

~~~
more scripts/guppy_fastmodel.sl
~~~
{: .bash}


~~~
#!/bin/bash -e 

#SBATCH --job-name      guppy_basecalling
#SBATCH --time          00:10:00
#SBATCH --mem           4G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 2
#SBATCH --output        guppy_%j.out
#SBATCH --account       nesi02659
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node A100-1g.5gb:1

module purge
module load ont-guppy-gpu/6.2.1

guppy_basecaller -i fast5_pass  -s fastq_fastmodel \
 --config /opt/nesi/CS400_centos7_bdw/ont-guppy-gpu/6.2.1/data/dna_r9.4.1_450bps_fast.cfg  \
 --device auto  --recursive --records_per_fastq 4000 --min_qscore 7 --compress_fastq
~~~
{: .output}

 - The `SBATCH` commands are providing information to the `slurm` job scheduler: job name, maximum run time, memory allocation etc
 - The `module` commands are making sure the necessary modules are available to the script (here we are specifying version 6.2.1 of `ont-guppy-gpu` - the GPU-enabled version of ONT's guppy software).
 - The `guppy_basecaller` command is what is doing the work (i.e., converted the .fast5 data to .fastq).

 Let's have a closer look at the `guppy_basecaller` command:

~~~
guppy_basecaller \
  -i fast5_pass_subset  \
  -s fastq_fastmodel \
  --config /opt/nesi/CS400_centos7_bdw/ont-guppy-gpu/6.2.1/data/dna_r9.4.1_450bps_fast.cfg  \
  --device auto \ 
  --recursive \
  --records_per_fastq 4000 \
  --min_qscore 7 \
  --compress_fastq
~~~
{: .output}

Options used:

 - `-i fast5_pass_subset`: where to find the fast5 files (note the we are assuming that the script in run from the directory: `~/obss_2022/nanopore/`)
 - `-s fastq_fastmodel`: the name of the folder where the .fastq files will be written to.
 - `-config /opt/nesi/CS400_centos7_bdw/ont-guppy-gpu/6.2.1/data/dna_r9.4.1_450bps_fast.cfg`: this specifies the model that is being used to perform the basecalling.  In this case we are using the "fast" model (rather than high-accuracy (hac) or super-high accuracy (sup)) to save time, and `dna` denotes that we sequenced... DNA. `r9.4.1` refers to the flowcell version that was used to generate the data, and 450bps is the speed at which the DNA passes through the pore (450 bases per second).
 - `--device auto`: this refers to which GPU device should be used (here we let the software select `auto`matically, but it can sometimes be useful to select specific GPU devices).
 - `--recursive`: search recursively for `.fast5` files (actually all our `.fast5` files are in the folder, so this isn't needed here).
 - `--records_per_fastq 4000`: number of reads to include per `.fastq` file.
 - `--min_qscore 7`: minimum average base quality score to considered a read to have "passed" QC.
 - `--compress_fastq`: create compressed (`.fastq.gz`) files.

To submit the script, we use the `sbatch` command, and run it from the `~/obss_2022/nanopore/ecoli-data` directory. You can check 
if you are in that directory with `pwd`.  If not: `cd ~/obss_2022/nanopore/ecoli-data`.

To run the script:

~~~
sbatch scripts/guppy_fastmodel.sl
~~~
{: .bash}


Once the script has been submitted, you can check to make sure it is running via:

~~~
# This shows all your current jobs
squeue --me
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
JOBID         USER     ACCOUNT   NAME        CPUS MIN_MEM PARTITI START_TIME     TIME_LEFT STATE    NODELIST(REASON)

~~~
{: .output}


It will also write progress to a log file that contains the job ID (represented by `XXXXXXX` in the code below). 
You can check the file name using `ls -ltr` (list file details, in reverse time order).  
Using the `tail -f` command, we can watch the progress (use control-c to exit):

~~~
ls -ltr
tail -f guppy_XXXXXXX.out
~~~
{: .bash}

Use "Control-c" to exit (it's okay, it won't kill the job).

The job should take around 6 minutes to run.

Once the job has completed successfully, the `.fastq` files can be found at `fastq_fastmodel`:

~~~
ls -1 fastq_fastmodel
~~~
{: .bash}

Note that `pass` and `fail` subfolders have been created.

~~~
ls -l fastq_fastmodel/pass/
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
ls -l fastq_fastmodel/fail/
~~~
{: .bash}

Note that both directories (`pass` and `fail`) contain the same number of files, and they have exactly the same names.  BUT, their content is different: the `.fastq.gz` files in the `pass` folder contain data for the reads that have passed QC (average base quality above threshold), and the `fail` folder contains those that failed. The files in the `pass` folder should be (hopefully!) much larger those their counterparts in the `fail` folder.

~~~
ls -lh fastq_fastmodel/pass/fastq_runid_15ca037c8ec4904bf5408d8ae5a1abecb8458aee_0_0.fastq.gz

~~~
{: .output}

Here the first `.fastq.gz` file (in the `pass` folder) contains 5.7M of data, whereas the one in the `fail` folder only contains 672K (i.e., it is about 1/12 of the size).
